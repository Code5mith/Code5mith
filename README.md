# welcome

Hi there! welcome to  [channal manes ] github repo. 

As an aspiring programmer, it can definitely be overwhelming to choose a niche to specialize in. However, with the current advancements in AI and machine learning, there are many exciting opportunities available for those who are interested in this field.

One approach to exploring AI and machine learning is to start with the fundamentals. Learn the basics of programming, data structures, and algorithms, and then move on to learning about machine learning concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. 

Here on [channal name] we will be exploring every bit of the AI world and take a more practical aproach to understand the concepts and theories. I you may have heard before many say that you have to have a very strong background in maths to start data science but trust me you  dont perhaps thats the only  thing that is
holding a lot of us from becoming AI developers. Every maths concept you will need will be discoussed in my youtube channal to so no worries.

Ultimately, the key is to keep learning and experimenting, and to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. AI and machine learning are rapidly evolving, and there are always new techniques and approaches to explore. So don't be afraid to try new things, and enjoy the process of discovering what you can create with AI and machine learning.

Thanks for visiting my page and I look forward to connecting with you!
